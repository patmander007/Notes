Learn and Understand AngularJS

Model, View, Whatever - MV*
	Whatever, whatever works for you

data or data-ng can be handled by angularjs

Modules, Apps, and Controllers

Dependency injection: giving a function an object.
	rather than creating an object inside a function, you pass it to the function

The Scope Service
	binds the model to the view
	$scope is an object
	all angular services start with a dollar sign. $

How does Angular do dependency injection
	angular.injector().annotate(functionName)
		will return an array of inputs
	
Javascript Arrays can contain functions

Dependency Injection and Minification
	minification - shrinking the size of files for faster download.
		we normally add .min to the name of the file. so file.js becames file.min.js, so we can tell the difference.

Scope and Interpolation
	Interpolation
		creating a string by combining strings and placeholders
			'My name is'+ name -> is interpolated, and results in 'My name is Tony'
			
$timeout(function(){}, timeOutMilli)
	trigger,
	
Directives and Two Way Data Binding
	Directive:
		An instruction to AngularJS to manipulate a piece of the DOM.
			- this could be 'add a class', 'hide this', 'create this', etc.,
	ng-model="<var name>"
		used for two-way binding, automatically tied to $scope
		
Watchers and the Digest Loop
	the thing that connects the model and view

	The Javascript Event Loop
		keypress, click, mouseover, change
	
	$scope.$watch(<var>, function(newValue, oldValue){
	
	});
	a watcher, to track the changes or monitors the changes of <var>
	
	$scope.$apply(function(){
	
	});
	tell angular to apply it's digest cycle, when using functions outside angular
	
Common Directives
	
	ng-if="<anything that returns true/false>"
		completely removes or allows to exist the tag
	
	ng-show="<anything that returns true/false>"
		adds a ng-hide if false, 
	
	ng-hide="<anything that returns true/false>"
		adds a ng-hife if true
	
	ng-class="{json}"
		{'alert-warning': jsExpression}
		alert-warning class will be added to the class if jsExpression is true
	
	ng-repeat="x in collection"
	
	ng-click, ng-keypress, ng-keydown, ng-changed
	
	ng-clock
		hides the element on the DOM until angular has worked on it
	
	go to angularjs.org, and api reference, and browse in directives
	
	
JavaScript Aside: The XMLHttpRequest Object
	native to the browser
	
External Data and $http
	$http
		.get, .success, .error, .post

Angular Aside: Multiple Controllers, Multiple Views
	$scope is unique per controller
	
JavaScript and HTML Aside: Single Page Apps and the Hash
	
Routing, Templates, and Controllers
	ngRoute
	$routeProvider
	$routeParams
	$location
	ng-view
	
JavaScript and Angular Aside - Variable Names and Normalization
	Normalize -  to make consistent to a standard
		specifically we are dealing with 'text normalization', or making strings of text consistent to a standard

Creating a custom Directive
	myApp.directive('<directiveName>', function (){
		return{
			restrict: 'AECM',
			template: '<template-here>',
			replace: true/false
		}	
	})
	
	template
		templateUrl
	scopes
		can be accessed also in the directive, but may be dangerous
		can be also isolated, by having scope:{} property in the directive
			for text: @
			for two-way binding: =
			for function: &
			
Understanding Compile
	Compile and Link:
		when building code, the compiler converts code to a lower-level language, then the linker generates a file the computer will actually interact with
	compile in angularjs
		compile: function(elem, attrs){
			//some codes
			return {
				
				pre: function(scope, element, attrs){
				
				},
				
				post: function(scope, element, attrs){
					
				}
				
			}
		}
			you can modify the html on the fly...
		
	link in angular js
		link: function(scope, elements, attrs){
		
		
		}
	
Understanding Transclusion
	Transclusion
		include one document inside another
			place a copy of one document at a particular point inside another.
	
	<small ng-transclude></small>
	<ng-transclude></ng-transclude>
